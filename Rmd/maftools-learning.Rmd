## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(maftools)
rt = read.maf(maf = "C:\\Users\\79211\\Downloads\\Compressed\\gdc_download_20210412_052559.816517\\2a8f2c83-8b5e-4987-8dbf-01f7ee24dc26\\TCGA.KIRC.mutect.2a8f2c83-8b5e-4987-8dbf-01f7ee24dc26.DR-10.0.somatic.maf\\TCGA.KIRC.mutect.2a8f2c83-8b5e-4987-8dbf-01f7ee24dc26.DR-10.0.somatic.maf")

#### Plotting MAF summary.
plotmafSummary(maf = rt, rmOutlier = TRUE, addStat = 'median', dashboard = TRUE, titvRaw = FALSE)
```

#### Drawing oncoplots 
#### Better representation of maf file can be shown as oncoplots, also known as waterfall plots.
# oncoplot for top ten mutated genes.

```{r cars}
oncoplot(maf = rt, top = 10)
```

NOTE: Variants annotated as Multi_Hit are those genes which are mutated more than once in the same sample.
